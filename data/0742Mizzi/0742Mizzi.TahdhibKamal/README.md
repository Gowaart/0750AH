Please, copy-paste questions from `text_questionnaire.md` into this file and answer the questions.
If you have done so, please check if `text_questionnaire.md` has been updated and has new questions.

## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

Shamela was chosen, which seems to be as good as JK, concerning the number of marked entries. Schia has poor quality. PDF is close to all of them.

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Link for PDF is in url-document.
Pagination is the same.


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

four typos found - all concerning numbering

## 4. Add any comments on the text

very time consuming, because there were 35 volumes and some entries couldn't be marked by regex very well. The quality of the tagging is good I would suppose, sometimes still I didn't checked with the PDF to save time. 
In the last volume there is a section with womens biographies.
- first 250 pages are not properly marked yet
- some of the cross references are still marked with $ instead of $$. They are the ones without numbers so it should be easy to find them.


V 1: entries 1-133 complete (+-2)
V 2: entries 134-410 complete(+-2)
V 3: entries 411-634 complete (+-2)
V 4: entries 635-931 complete (+-2)
V 5: entries 932-1183 complete(+-2)
V 6: entries 1184-1384 complete(+-2)
V 7: entries 1385-1586 complete(+-2)
V 8: entries 1587-1823 complete(+-2)
V 9: entries 1824-2083 complete(+-2)
V10: entries 2084-2325 complete(+-2)
V11: entries 2326-2531
V12: entries 2531-2792

Another case concerns the expression من الاوهام  which is marked by ### ||  about 250 times. As it is not highlighted in the PDF I was wondering if it has another structuring function or not? What I mean is: Should it be tagged or not? What about similar cases - expressions that occour regularly and which are tagged, but are no headlines in the PDFs?
